# 📊 Big Data Engineering Capstone Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of a **Big Data Engineering Capstone** and focuses on analyzing large real-world datasets using Python, databases, and data processing techniques. The goal is to show how raw data can be **extracted, transformed, stored, analyzed, and visualized** to generate meaningful insights.

The project uses **YouTube Trending Videos data** and demonstrates practical skills that are essential in big data and data engineering roles.

## 🧩 What This Project Does

In simple terms, this project:

* Takes a large YouTube dataset (CSV file)
* Stores it in a database
* Processes the data in batches
* Cleans and restructures the data
* Analyzes trends and patterns
* Visualizes results to make insights easy to understand

---

## 📁 Project Contents

* **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)** – Python code for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)
* **CSV Dataset** – YouTube trending video data (US dataset)
* **PDF Reports** – Written analysis and answers to inference questions
* **Charts & Images** – Visualizations showing trends, categories, and upload patterns
* **README.md** – Project explanation and overview

---

## 🔄 Data Processing Workflow (ETL)

### 1️⃣ Extract

* Data is read from a database in **daily batches**
* Each batch represents videos trending on a specific day

### 2️⃣ Transform

* Dates are cleaned and reformatted
* Video titles are processed and categorized
* Unnecessary columns are removed
* Data is prepared for analysis

### 3️⃣ Load

* Cleaned data is stored back into the database
* Separate tables are created for each video category

---

## 📈 Analysis & Insights

The project answers important questions such as:

* What time of day are most videos uploaded?
* Which video categories are the most popular?
* Which videos receive the most likes and comments?
* How many videos exist per category?

These insights help understand **viewer behavior and content trends** on YouTube.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes visual representations such as:

* Bar charts of video uploads by time segment
* Category vs number of videos
* Category vs likes and comments

These visuals make the data easy to interpret, even for non-technical users.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)
* **SQL / Database** (MySQL / MariaDB / SQLite)
* **CSV datasets**
* **Data visualization tools** (charts & graphs)
* **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

* Big data handling and processing
* ETL pipeline design
* Database integration
* Data analysis and inference
* Data visualization
* Clean, well-documented code
